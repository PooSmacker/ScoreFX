/**
 * Represents a single, per-player scoreboard.
 * <p>
 * A Board provides methods to set the title, add/update lines, and display animations.
 * Scoreboards support up to 15 visible lines (rows 1-15), with row 1 appearing at the
 * bottom and row 15 appearing at the top.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Modern API (v1.1.0+):</strong> ScoreFX now supports Adventure Components, enabling
 * full RGB colors, gradients, hover/click events, and other modern text features. The new
 * Component-based methods are the preferred way to interact with scoreboards.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Legacy Support:</strong> The original String-based methods continue to work and
 * support legacy formatting with '&amp;' color codes and hex colors via #RRGGBB format.
 * If PlaceholderAPI is installed, placeholder resolution works for String-based methods only.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Thread Safety:</strong> All methods that modify the board's state are strictly
 * main-thread only and will throw an {@link IllegalStateException} if called from any other thread.
